# Shopify Variant Scraper Discord Bot

Simple nodeJS application that fetches product variants for any specific product on any given shopify store.

## Get Started

* Clone the repository on your machine and create a file named `config.env`, where you will **store all sensitive data such as tokens and webhook URLs.**
* In the `config.env` file, create `TOKEN` and add your own bot's discord token, and `WEBHOOK_URL` which will hold the value of your channel's webhook URL.
* In a terminal in the project directory, run `npm install` to install all dependencies and packages necessary to get the script up and running.
* Finally, run `npm run dev` in the terminal and the bot will start running.

## Using the bot

* In the discord channel where the webhook is connected, send the command `$var <productlink>` for any product on any shopify store and the bot will respond with an image of the product, the product name, all sizes available and their respective variants.
